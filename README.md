Switch Code Smell

This is an exercise to Refactor Middle Man code smell in Java
Specially when there's many if statements or switches.

We should consider using Polymorphism when we see this use cases
We should add Interfaces and Abstracts classes to make the code cleaner.


On the package file /src/main/java/org/example/codesmell/
In there you will encounter the code smell with middle man

This is the refactored package /src/main/java/org/example/refactored/
You can look into the Account Interface and AccountCommon abstract classes.
they enabled me to make the code cleaner and More readable
When we go to the BankApp the code is a lot more flexible.
